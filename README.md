# Flowdock Notifications for Bitrise

This is a step for Bitrise to post to your flow's inbox on the build status.


## How to use this Step

In order to use this step, you must create a shortcut application in your
Flowdock account's developer applications. From there create a source token
for the desired flow, and use that token in the step config. More information
can be found at the [Flowdock API Reference](https://www.flowdock.com/api/developing-integrations).
